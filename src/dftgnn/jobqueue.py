"""File-based, resumable job queue for training runs (no database, no git needed on the pod).

    jobs/pending/<run_id>.json   waiting
    jobs/running/<run_id>.json   claimed; jobs/running/<run_id>.hb is its heartbeat (mtime)
    jobs/done/<run_id>.json      finished (adds status, result path, wall time)
    jobs/failed/<run_id>.json    raised (adds the traceback)

A claim is ``os.rename`` from pending/ to running/. On one filesystem it is atomic, so exactly one
worker wins each job. A running job whose heartbeat is older than ``STALE_S`` (10 min) returns to
pending. A job may list ``after`` run ids (e.g. P after its P1 and D runs) and is claimable only when
all of them are in done/.

VRAM-aware admission (S07). A job may carry ``est_peak_gb`` (the benchmark's realistic peak times a
1.25 safety factor, ``dftgnn.train.admission``). With ``vram_gb`` given, ``claim`` admits a job only
if the sum of ``est_peak_gb`` over the running jobs plus the new one is at most ``ADMIT_FRACTION`` (0.85)
of ``vram_gb``. The check and the claim run under an exclusive ``fcntl`` lock on ``<root>/.admit.lock``,
so concurrent workers cannot over-admit. A job whose estimate is missing is treated as needing the
whole admissible budget. An out-of-memory error requeues the job with ``needs_solo = true``; a solo job
is admitted only when nothing else is running, no other job is admitted while a solo job runs, and
while a solo job is ready and pending no other job is admitted either (so it cannot starve).
