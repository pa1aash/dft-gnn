"""Extended outer resamples r = 10..29 (EXTENSION, not pre-registered; docs/deviations.md, 2026-10-11).

Physics. Each resample asks the same question as the ten registered ones: how well does a model trained on B
hosts place the formation energies of 164 hosts it never saw? Twenty more draws of the same design narrow the
resample-level spread of A at the two largest budgets without changing any registered split.

Design, unchanged from ``dftgnn.split.outer_split``: 20% of the 818 hosts to test, stratified by host-mean E_f
quintile with largest-remainder allocation; the remaining 654-host pool in a random order whose first B hosts
form the budget-B training set (nested budgets). The outer seed of resample r is r, continuing
``split.seeds`` = [0, ..., 9]; the budget-order seed is ``derived_seed(r, "budget_order")`` as before.

Written once by ``scripts/make_splits_ext.py`` to ``splits/resamples_10_29.json``; read with
``dftgnn.split.load_split(f"outer_r{r}")``.
