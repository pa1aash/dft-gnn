"""Extended-budget grouped K-fold cross-validation (EXTENSION, not pre-registered; docs/deviations.md, 2026-10-11).

Physics. The outer resamples cap training at 654 hosts and leave 79 hosts never tested. K-fold CV over the 818
hosts trains on 736-778 hosts and tests every host exactly once per K, so the pooled out-of-fold predictions
place every host's formation energy from a model that never saw it.

Folds (group = host = formula), for each K in {10, 20}: rank the hosts by (host-mean E_f, host_id) and cut the
ranking into five quintile groups with ``numpy.array_split`` (the strata of ``dftgnn.split.outer_split``); a fresh
``numpy.random.default_rng(20261010)`` permutes each group in ascending-E_f order; the permuted groups are
concatenated and host i of that order goes to fold i mod K. Fold sizes therefore differ by at most one, and every
fold draws evenly from the E_f range. The training set of a fold is every host outside it.

The split name of fold f of K is ``cv_v1_k{K}_f{f}`` (``RunSpec.r`` = f, ``RunSpec.budget`` = the fold's training
size). The validation carve-out is ``val_split`` with r replaced by the string f"cv{K}f{f}" (``val_r``).

Produced once by ``scripts/make_splits_ext.py`` as ``splits/cv_v1.json``; read with ``load_split("cv_v1")``.
