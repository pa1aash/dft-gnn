"""Leave-one-chemistry-out folds (ANALYSIS_PLAN section 11; clarification of 2026-10-10).

Physics. A chemistry family is the set of distinct periodic-table groups of a host's non-oxygen elements
(S02 definition ii-a; lanthanides and actinides count as group 3). Holding out whole families asks whether
the models transfer to cation chemistries they never saw, rather than to new hosts of familiar chemistry.

Folds: scikit-learn ``GroupKFold(n_splits=5)`` without shuffling, over the hosts sorted by host_id with the
family key as the group label. The training set of a fold is every host outside its test fold. The
family key reproduces ``scripts/audit_misc.py`` (``group_of`` and ``families``) element for element; a test
checks this on every host of universe v1.

Produced once by ``scripts/make_loco_splits.py`` as ``splits/loco_v1.json``; read thereafter with
``dftgnn.split.load_split("loco_v1")``.
