"""Linear probe of the structure-only model's readout vector (ANALYSIS_PLAN section 10; v2 arm, docs/deviations.md
2026-10-09).

For one S checkpoint: the readout input vector [vacancy node | pooled nodes | global state] (``readout_vector``)
is extracted for the run's training sites and test sites. Features are standardised with training-site
statistics. For each of the 22 D descriptors (standardised with training-site statistics), a ridge regression
is fitted with its strength chosen from ``ALPHAS`` by 5-fold ``GroupKFold`` over training hosts (lowest mean
squared error), refitted on all training sites and scored by test R^2. Controls: (a) the same probe on training
labels shuffled across training hosts (a host's sites keep one shuffled host's labels, so the host structure of
the labels is kept), scored on the true test labels; (b) the probe on the readout vector of an untrained network
with the same architecture and seed.
