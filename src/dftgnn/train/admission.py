"""VRAM and host-RAM estimates for the queue's admission control (S07 step 3).

``est_peak_gb`` of a job is the benchmark's realistic peak (``torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated`` over a
shuffled epoch, ``results/gpu_benchmark.json``) for its (hidden width, batch size, MEGNet blocks) times
``SAFETY`` = 1.25. The benchmark grid covers every cell of the search space. Models D-state, D-late, P1
and P differ from S only by a few input or output columns, so S's peak is used for all of them.
The workers' host-RAM estimate is the largest per-worker peak resident set in the concurrency runs.
