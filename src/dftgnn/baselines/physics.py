Oxide stability (Kumagai et al. 2021, Sec. II I and III D): column ``formation_energy``, the host
formation energy per atom (eV/atom) from the Materials Project, empirically corrected. More negative
means a more stable oxide. Band gap: column ``band_gap``, the PBEsol(+U) gap of the pristine host (eV)
as released. Both are host properties; the descriptors of Deml et al. use the same two quantities.
