"""Cation d-electron bins of the hosts (ANALYSIS_PLAN section 9; clarification of 2026-10-10).

Physics. The geometry sensitivity of a vacancy energy plausibly depends on whether the cations near the
vacancy have open d shells (strong ligand-field and Jahn-Teller coupling to distortions) or closed ones.
Each host is binned by the d-shell occupancy of its cations in their formal oxidation states.

Oxidation states: pymatgen ``BVAnalyzer`` on the DFT unit cell first, then the first
``Composition.oxi_state_guesses`` solution; if both fail the host is "unassigned". Cations are the species
with a positive oxidation state.

d count of a cation of element X in state q:
    groups 3-12 (transition metals, group-3 metals included): group(X) - q
    p-block with a filled (n-1)d shell (period >= 4, groups 13-17): 10, whatever q (Ga3+, In3+, Sn2+/4+,
        Pb2+/4+, Bi3+, Sb3+/5+, Tl+/3+, Ge4+, As5+, Te4+/6+, Se4+/6+ ...)
    s-block, early p-block (periods 2-3) and the f-block (lanthanides and actinides): 0
Host bin: "d0" if no cation has d electrons; "d10" if at least one cation is d10 and none is partially
filled; "other" if any cation has a d count strictly between 0 and 10. A d count outside [0, 10] (an
unphysical state assignment) makes the host "unassigned" with the reason recorded.
